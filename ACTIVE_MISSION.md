# ABI active mission

Status date: 2026-08-03

## State

The ABI capability-compiler moonshot is **OPEN**.

Phase 0 is complete, Phase 1 is complete, and Phase 2 is open but not started.

| Phase | State | Authority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 — definitions and preregistration | COMPLETE | `ABI_CAPABILITY_COMPILER_PHASE0_CERTIFICATE_V1.json` |
| 1 — normalized acquisition IR | COMPLETE | `ABI_CAPABILITY_COMPILER_PHASE1_CERTIFICATE_V1.json` |
| 2 — matched LoRA and distillation baselines | OPEN_NOT_STARTED | `ABI_CAPABILITY_COMPILER_CAMPAIGN_STATE_V2.json` |
| 3–8 | LOCKED | Campaign contract |

Phase 1 certifies a data artifact, not a model. It selected 7,000 normalized
English records—500 for each of 14 capabilities—with raw forms, authoritative
token IDs, provenance, labels, transformations, and content hashes. It also
freezes disjoint development, final, isolation, and hostile material.

The original source run failed the abstention floor and remains preserved. A
fresh, preregistered successor supplied 400 new passing abstention records; none
of the failed records were reclassified. Specialist inventories are
evaluation-only, and no specialist record is eligible for English training.

## Active objective: Phase 2

Build and certify strong, fair LoRA and distillation baselines before training
an ABI candidate. Freeze the exact implementations and hashes before observing
training outcomes, use identical source information where the protocol
requires it, and report all imported information and deployment dependencies.

Phase 2 must not claim that ABI has transferred capability or outperformed a
baseline. Its purpose is to establish credible competitors and a reproducible
comparison floor.

## Stop boundaries

- Do not begin Phase 3 candidate training during Phase 2.
- Do not use final-test outputs for tuning, repair, source selection, or early
  stopping.
- Do not silently replace the certified Phase 1 artifact.
- Preserve failed baselines and underperforming configurations.
- Do not describe ABI as better than LoRA or distillation until the full
  matched evidence supports that bounded claim.
- Keep detailed LayerCake implementation and research status in the separate
  [LayerCake repository](https://github.com/Yoder23/layercake).

overrides this phase boundary.
